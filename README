How to solve the marker based localization problem?
----

* Preprocess
- [Done] Marker or marker image candidate with enough feature points (this case a "cave" image)
- [Done] SuperPoint to extract and store the features for the marker candidate
- [Done] Based on marker physical location config, calculate 3d position of marker candidate's feature points

* Runtime
- [Done] Image transform for input image (resize, tensor...)
- [Done] SuperPoint to extract features for input images
- [Done] SuperGlue to match features between query image and marker candidates, generate 2d-3d pairs for input image
- [Done] PnP solver to calculate T_world_camera for the query image
- [Done] Coordinate transform for T_physical_ar
